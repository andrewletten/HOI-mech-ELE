 **01-HOI-generatedata.R** - Generate 'observed' data from simulations of consumer-resource models. See `/data` for simulation output.

 **02-HOI-fitmodels.R** - Fit (higher-order) Lotka-Volterra models to observed data and resimulate to compare fits. See `/data/modelfits` for output.

 **03-HOI-summarizefits.R** - Summarize static and dynamic fits (Figs 3-8 in ms)
